See [README.md](./README.md) for the overall structure and purpose of this repo.
This document focuses on the use of agentic AI to brainstorm and organize information.

## Additional Instructions for Agentic AI

### Markdown Format
- Use Markdown format for all outputs, including lists, tables, links, and diagrams (Mermaid).
- Use headings and subheadings to organize information clearly.
- If a line is longer than 120 characters, break lines at 100 characters to improve readability in Git/IDEs.
  - It is OK to keep a few 120-char lines in listings etc.
  - Do not break if it reduces readability.
  - Do not break links or code snippets.

### Text Style
- Write in a clear and concise way, avoiding unnecessary words or jargon.
- Use bullet points and numbered lists to organize information when appropriate.
- Avoid long paragraphs; break them into smaller sections with headings if needed.
- Use British English spelling (e.g., "prioritise" instead of "prioritize")
  for consistency with the existing documents.
- Use thing A, thing B, and thing C; use ", and" as used in scientific writing, not "and" as in conversational writing.
- Propose to replace invented terms with more intuitive ones if they are not widely used or understood.
  Example: "Engen Chair" is not clear to people outside the platform team, so it was renamed to "Platform Chair".
- Challenge yourself to write shorter docs by not typing out every detail and assume some common sense and knowledge on
  the reader's part.
