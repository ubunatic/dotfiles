# Dotfile Projects Overview

Dotfiles are configuration files used to personalize and configure software applications, typically stored in hidden directories (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`). These projects often include scripts for setting up environments, customizing shell behavior, managing application settings, and automating repetitive tasks. They can be version-controlled using Git to easily replicate setups across different machines.
