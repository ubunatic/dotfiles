# Documentation Update

Analyze the code in this repository and update the documentation accordingly.

## Requirements
- Always use the IDE for file modifications (creating, editing, deleting files)
- At the bottom of AI-driven documentation files, add a section describing how
  to update the documentation using this skill.
- Hard break text, bullet points, and other formatting at 80 characters.
- Do not break links, code snippets, diagrams, or other structured content.
- Split big tables into smaller ones if needed to fit the line length.
- Revise clunky or complex sentences for better readability.
- Revise long paragraphs into smaller ones for better readability.
- Use short sentences where possible, but do not sacrifice clarity.
- Use consistent terminology throughout the documentation.
- Ensure proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

## Step 1. List Existing Documentation
- find the current documentation files in the repository
- summarize their content and purpose
- Create/Update a `DOCS.md` to maintain an index of documentation files.
  Add a :warning: sign on outdated documents.
- Use Markdown links to link to each documentation file for easy access.

Pause here and wait for user confirmation before proceeding to Step 2.

## Step 2. Analyze Codebase
- Analyze the codebase to identify any new features, changes, or removed
  functionalities.
- Compare the current state of the codebase with the existing documentation.
- Identify discrepancies, missing information, or outdated sections in the
  documentation.
- Create a list of documentation updates needed, categorized by sections or
  topics.

Pause here and wait for user confirmation before proceeding to Step 3.
The user may ask to focus on specific areas of the codebase.

## Step 3. Update Documentation
- For each identified update, generate the necessary documentation content.
- Ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency in the updated documentation.
- Format the documentation according to the repository's standards.
- Review the updated documentation for completeness and correctness.
- Integrate the updated documentation into the existing files or create new
  files as needed.

## Step 4. Final Review
- Conduct a final review of the entire documentation to ensure coherence and
  quality.
- Check for any remaining discrepancies or areas that may require further
  clarification.
