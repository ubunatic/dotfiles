# Init AI Environment

## Step 1.
Create or update my AGENTS.md file based on the current project state,
including any new files or changes since the last update.
Ensure the agents setup reflects the latest project structure and content.

## Step 2.
Review/Create/Update additional AI instruction files in the .ai/instructions/
dir. Make sure the same files exist in .github/instructions. Symlink .ai/DIR
to .github/DIR if not already done.

## Requirements

- Make sure the AI instructions are tailored to IDE-focused development,
  demanding integration with IDE features and workflows.
- Always use the IDE for file modifications (creating, editing, deleting files)
