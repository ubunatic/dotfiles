# Compression and Deduplication in Home Lab Environments

## Introduction
In home lab environments, efficient storage management is crucial. This includes not only organizing data but also optimizing it through compression and deduplication techniques. This document explores various strategies for implementing these techniques effectively.

### Compression Techniques
Compression reduces the size of data by encoding it more efficiently. Common compression algorithms include:

- **Lossless Compression**: Retains all original data (e.g., ZIP, Gzip).
- **Lossy Compression**: Sacrifices some data for higher compression ratios (e.g., JPEG, MP3).

### Tools for Compression
- **Gzip**: Widely used for compressing files on Linux systems.
- **Brotli**: A newer compression algorithm that often outperforms Gzip.
- **FFmpeg**: Useful for compressing audio and video files.

### Deduplication Techniques
Deduplication eliminates duplicate copies of data, saving storage space. This is particularly useful for virtual machines and backups.

### Block-Level Deduplication
- **How it Works**: Data is divided into blocks, and only unique blocks are stored.
- **Tools**:
  - **BorgBackup**: Supports deduplication for backups.
  - **ZFS**: Offers built-in deduplication features.

### File-Level Deduplication
- **How it Works**: Identifies and removes duplicate files.
- **Tools**:
  - **Rsync**: Can be used to identify and sync only changed files.
  - **fdupes**: A command-line tool for finding duplicate files.

### Best Practices
1. **Combine Compression and Deduplication**: Use both techniques for maximum storage efficiency.
2. **Regularly Monitor Storage Usage**: Keep an eye on storage consumption to identify opportunities for optimization.
3. **Test Different Tools**: Experiment with various compression and deduplication tools to find the best fit for your environment.

### Conclusion
Implementing compression and deduplication strategies in your home lab can lead to significant storage savings and improved efficiency. By leveraging the right tools and techniques, you can optimize your storage infrastructure effectively.

## Compression and Deduplication with ZFS and Btrfs

### ZFS

ZFS deduplication flow is as follows:
- assume there is a `file1` owned by user `user1` with permissions `644`
- copy `file1` to `/data/path2/file1`
  - ZFS compresses `file1` on disk (in the metadata it knows the original size and compressed size)
- copy `file1` again to `/data/path1/file1_copy1`
  - ZFS checks the file by its content hash and sees that it already has the same data stored
  - ZFS creates a new metadata entry for `file1_copy` that points to the same
- change owner of `file1` to `user2` and permissions to `600` (also updates timestamps)
- copy `file1` again to `/data/path3/file1_copy2`
The following table shows how ZFS manages the content and metadata for these three files:

| File Path                 | Owner   | Permissions | Content Hash | Stored Data Block | Compressed Size |
|---------------------------|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `/data/path2/file1`       | user1   | 644         | hash1        | blockA            | 1MB             |
| `/data/path1/file1_copy1` | user1   | 644         | hash1        | blockA            | 1MB             |
| `/data/path3/file1_copy2` | user2   | 600         | hash1        | blockA            | 1MB             |

The actual data block `blockA` is stored only once on disk, while the metadata entries for each file point to the same data block.
This saves disk space by avoiding duplicate storage of identical data.

For bigger files, ZFS breaks them into smaller blocks (default is 128KB) and performs deduplication at the block level.
This means that if two files share some identical blocks, those blocks are stored only once.

### ZSF bs CDC (Content Defined Chunking)

ZFS does not natively support Content Defined Chunking (CDC) for deduplication.
Small byte-level changes in files can lead to significant storage inefficiencies because ZFS deduplication is based on fixed-size blocks.
When a small change occurs, it can cause many blocks to be marked as unique, leading to increased storage usage.

Use file-level deduplication or third-party tools such as Restic, BorgBackup, or Kopia for CDC-like functionality.
