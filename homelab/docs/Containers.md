# Container Management in Homelab

To efficiently manage and deploy services in the homelab environment, containerization is utilized. Containers provide a lightweight and portable way to run applications consistently across different environments.

## Requirements
- **Repeatable Deployments**: Ensure that services can be easily redeployed with minimal effort. On different hardware or after system changes, the deployment process should remain consistent.
- **Configuration Management**: Store all configuration files in `git` and use Ansible for automation. This ensures that configurations are version-controlled and can be easily updated or rolled back.
- **Backup and Restore**: Implement a robust backup strategy to safeguard data and configurations. This includes regular backups of container volumes, configuration files, and any other critical data.
- **Secret Management**: Use secret management tools to handle sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and certificates securely.

## Tooling Options

The following table outlines various container orchestration and management tools, along with their pros and cons.

## Solution Assessment
- **Docker/Podman Compose**: Ideal for the current scale of the homelab. It allows for quick setup and management of containers with minimal overhead. Configuration files can be stored in `git`, and Ansible can be used to automate the deployment process.
- **Portainer**: Can be considered used on top of Docker/Podman for easier management through a graphical interface.

**Decision**: Start with Docker/Podman Compose for container management, leveraging Ansible for automation and configuration management. This approach balances ease of use, automation potential, and management effort effectively for the homelab environment.


## Deployment Flow
1. **Define Services**: List all services to be containerized and their respective configurations.
2. **Create Docker/Podman Compose Files**: Write `docker-compose.yml` or `podman-compose.yml` files for each service, specifying images, volumes, networks, and environment variables.
3. **Store Configuration in Git**: Commit all compose files and related configuration files to a `git` repository for version control.
4. **Automate with Ansible**: Create Ansible playbooks to automate the deployment of containers using the compose files. This includes tasks for pulling images, starting containers, and managing updates.
5. **Implement Backup Strategy**: Set up regular backups for container volumes and configuration files. Use tools like `rsync`, `cron`, or dedicated backup solutions.
6. **Manage Secrets**: Use secret management tools (e.g., Vaultwarden) to securely store and retrieve sensitive information needed by the containers.
7. **Monitor and Maintain**: Regularly monitor container health and performance. Update services as needed and ensure backups are functioning correctly.
8. **Documentation**: Document the entire deployment process, including how to add new services, update existing ones, and restore from backups. This documentation should be stored in the `homelab/docs` directory for easy access.
